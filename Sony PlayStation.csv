007 - The World Is Not Enough (USA)>007 - The World Is Not Enough>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts>Black Ops Entertainment>Shooter>3.2>1 Player>007: The World is Not Enough is based off of the 1999 James Bond film of the same name. In it, Pierce Brosnan's Bond must investigate the murder of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new pipeline, which leads to a larger sinister plot requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to diffuse.  This version of the game has a few notable differences to its Nintendo 64 counterpart: it runs off a version of the Medal of Honor engine, and has 11 missions in contrast to the N64's 14; some of which are not shared between the two. The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry. This version does not feature additional objectives at higher difficulty modes, and only cheats are unlocked by beating specific missions at a specific difficulty. However, it does feature CD-quality music and voices, as well as video clips from the movie for cutscenes. It is single-player only, and features no multiplayer component.
007 - Tomorrow Never Dies (USA)>007 - Tomorrow Never Dies>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts>Black Ops Entertainment>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>In 007: Tomorrow Never Dies, which is based on the movie of the same name, the player takes the role of the famous James Bond who fights against Elliot Carver. Carver tries to increase his TV ratings by creating a war between the British and the Chinese. To achieve his goal he sunk a British ship with his stealth ship and made it look like the Chinese Air Force was the offender. Now it is Bond's responsibility to set things right...  Most of the ten levels are like traditional third-person-shooters where the player walks around the levels while killing numerous foes. While there is an option for a free aim most enemies can be dispatched with the auto-lock function. This means if the player gets close enough to an enemy while using an appropriate gun the game automatically shoots at him when the player faces the general direction. Bond also has gadgets to his disposal which are used to fulfill the mission goals. There are two missions which differ from this formula: in the driving sequence the player chases and shoots at enemy cars while avoiding obstacles; during the skiing part he is mainly concerned with dispatching other skiers which want to bring him out of balance.

However, the game gains a new dimension in the ""arcade mode"", where it's possible to bend the rules with infamous kicks to the head or unleash the trademark move of the series - the Predator Megakick, named after the then revolutionary boot models. However, doing those decrease the players' stamina meter, and after the bar is depleted, players not only no longer can make special moves, but also take longer to recover from a tackle, so longer games can be won (or lost) by the number of players that can't feel their legs no more."

The gameplay is basically the same: the player can choose from a selection of characters (this time from the Animaniacs cartoon) with varying statistics, or build a new character from the ground up. This character is then positioned with the digital pad facing the bowling lane and its pins. Pressing X starts the ball launch where the screen switches to a side view of the character holding the ball and three gauges appear: Two tricolored ones for speed and accuracy and a smaller green one for putting a spin on the ball. Initially, the player can fill the spin gauge by pressing both the digital pad and X. After some seconds, a fast meter starts to move on the other gauges. The objective is to press X when it reaches the yellow band on each gauge. If it misses this mark, the character fumbles and drops the ball.
Animorphs - Shattered Reality (USA)>Animorphs - Shattered Reality>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Single Trac Entertainment Tech. Inc.>Action>2.4>1 Player>ANIMORPHS: Shattered Reality is a quasi-3D platformer based on the popular Scholastic book series.  A quick back story: Earth is being secretly conquered by an alien race known as the Yeerks, small slug like creatures that enter a host’s ear, latch onto their brain, and completely control them.  The only thing standing between the Yeerks and total domination is the Animorphs, a group of kids who have the power to morph into any animal form they can touch.  ****In Shattered Reality, the leader of the Yeerk invasion, Visser 3, has a plan to finally take over the world.  Using a device called “the Continuum Crystal”, Visser 3 plans to manipulate the space-time continuum in such as to change reality, making his invasion force the rulers of Earth, with no more Animorphs to fight against him.  However, as he activates the continuum crystal, is misfires, shatters itself and the shards of the crystal become scattered.  The Animorphs must collect all the shards of the shattered crystal to prevent Visser 3 from achieving his evil designs.****You then control the various members of the Animorphs crew, leading them through several differently themed levels (forests, swamps, urban, factories, underwater, subway tunnels, spacecraft, etc.) to collect the pieces of the crystal.  Most of the gameplay is jumping around on platforms collecting coins, battling aliens (when you encounter an alien, you automatically morph from your human self into your “battle morph”, which is a unique animal for each character), defeating the occasional boss alien, and trying not to fall.  A few levels are more of a 3rd person race, rather than platform based, as you navigate a dolphin, dragonfly, bat, or hawk (one of the Animorphs in another one of their animal forms) down a dangerous path.  All the levels are quite linear in nature.  At the end of each level, you collect a piece of the crystal.  If for some reason you fail in your quest, you get to see a movie of what happens to Earth when the Yeerks finally take over.  If you succeed, you are rewarded with a nice “winning” video.

Some will barely pay attention to you and will prefer to goof off or sleep, while others will attack you with machine guns, rocket launchers, and UFOs. Weapons will only stun a monkey, and they must be captured using the Time Net.****Finding every monkey in a level will unlock a time attack mode for the level, and collecting Specter Coins hidden in levels will unlock bonus games like boxing and skiing that use the dual stick controls.

Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.****Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features."

You play as Asterix, Obelix and the rest of the Celtic Gaul army as they war with the Romans, led by Caesar, who have seized all but one territory from the Gaul Empire. After gathering your army, you must capture lands adjacent to yours.  When you attack a neighbouring land, you'll either: play a side-scrolling action sequence, your men will go into war with that land's forces, or you'll play one of four mini-games. These include 'Throw the Roman' and 'Bowling for Romans', while the side-scrolling action sequences have you collecting coins and other items. If you make it through the level alive, you gain control of the land and its resources.  In some usually smaller territories, there are no mini-games or action sequences, only combat between your troops and the opposing forces. You only choose how many men you wish to send to war, and watch as the battle is fought. There are 9 differing levels such as a Roman camp, Gallo-Roman village, the Alps and even a Pirate's Ship to add variety.

The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary.  The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles. Single race mode lets the player compete against another player or the computer A.I. on any of the six tracks in the game.

Time Trial lets the player race solo, trying to defeat a track in as little time as possible.  Options include setting the difficulty level (easy or medium), setting the number of laps (3, 5, 9 or 50), and whether to turn vibration on or off.

The goal is to destroy the opponent's castle (or something else, as described in the mission briefing). But here ends the similarity to any other strategy game. To accomplish your mission, you have no armys to command - your only weapons are ballistic: cannons, catapults and the like. Add a bomber airship and some magic effects and you get a very strange mix :)****Everything takes place in a 3D environment. You can build your own castle and it's surroundings, like peasant huts, blacksmith and so on and place some weapons. These things cost gold, and you get gold by collecting taxes from the peasants. To destroy the opponent's castle, you use your guns, catapults... You aim and shoot with an easy interface - you cannot see where the shot will hit before it has hit, so you need to shoot more than once to target more precise. You can have multiple guns and switch between them to bombard your enemy with heavy stones, cannonballs etc. You can even upgrade these weapons to become even more deadly. Be aware that you cannot fire these weapons all the time - they need time to reload and every shot needs to be paid.****And what does your opponent do? Well, the same as you do - he shoots at your settlement, trying to cut you short of peasants so you cannot buy anything (you should try the same :) and then finish off your castle. To hinder him, you can ""disturb"" him by using wizards. They can send sandstorms, rain (making a bad sight for shooting) ... ****What does the name ""Ballerburg"" mean? It's German and can be translated to ""Blasting castle"" - ""Baller"" means to shoot something with really heavy artillery (it's ""every-day"" german language) and ""Burg"" means castle.****The game supports multiplayer and hotseat mode up to 4 players at once."

In the single player game, players choose to play as either a man or a woman, choose the color of their clothes, and then choose an area they want to fish in. There are two lakes to choose from at the start of the game, but more can be unlocked by completing challenges. An example of a challenge would be trying to catch a set number of fish in five casts. These challenges are given to the player by fellow anglers, who also offer advice and tips to the player. Also, completing challenges may also earn the player new lures to use.****The VS. mode lets from 2 to 4 players take turns fishing against each other. Players can choose how many casts are allowed (from 1 to 5 casts), how many games the competition will last (from 1 to 5 rounds), and what event to compete in (length, most weight, or number of fish caught).****Once the player is ready to start fishing, they choose from a various amount of Megabass brand lures such as the Pop-X or V-Flat lures, to add to their tackle box. After they decide what lures they want in their tackle box, the player heads out to the lake and chooses their lure, line strength (8,12,or 16 pounds), and where they want to cast their line. Once they get a fish to bite, they have to reel it in while being careful not to snap their line by letting their line tension meter fill all the way.****The game keeps track of the players record weight and length catches of large mouth bass, small mouth bass, and blue gill.

Battle Arena Toshinden (USA)>Battle Arena Toshinden>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>SCEA>Takara.>Fighter>3.6>1-2 Players>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.****Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.****The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. ****The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. ****Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.****The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.
Battle Arena Toshinden 2 (USA)>Battle Arena Toshinden 2>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Playmates>Takara.>Fighter>3.2>1-2 Players>Battle Arena Toshinden 2 is the first sequel to Battle Arena Toshinden.****It adds three new starting fighters; Tracy and Chaos with the original game's final boss, Gaia returning un-armoured and with a completely new move set. There are also three new bosses and hidden characters raising the total number of fighters to 15 (up from 10).****Toshinden 2, on top of additional special attacks for every character, adds several running attacks to each character: the ability to strike a grounded opponent with new ground attacks and the powerful Overdrive attacks that one must fill up a bar by using other attacks to be able to use.****Toshinden 2 also does away with the free-form combo system of the original Toshinden replacing it with a simple combo system (i.e. light attack, hard attack, special or light attack, light attack, hard attack, special). The 3D movement in Toshinden 2 has also been made notably slower to prevent the heavy abuse it could be used for in the original.****As a result, while the core game play is similar, this sequel is more tactical than the original game. Where as in the original Toshinden, one could throw normal attacks (i.e. light slashes) around with fairly reckless abandon and sidestep repeatedly without fear of their opponent being able to counter them easily, opponents in Toshinden 2 are able to capitalize on individual missed attacks.****As a result, Toshinden 2 is more balanced than its predecessor. This balance was further tweaked with a re-release called &quot;Toshinden 2 plus&quot; in Japan.****Unlike the Playstation release of the original Toshinden, Toshinden 2 was not re-dubbed for releases outside of Japan.****Also unlike the original Toshinden, the PC release of Toshinden 2 for Windows computers, is a straight port of the Playstation version and supports Direct3D rather than specific 3D cards.
Battle Arena Toshinden 3 (USA) (En,Ja)>Battle Arena Toshinden 3>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Playmates>Takara.>Fighter>2.9>1-2 Players>The third instalment of the Toshinden series.****After the defeat of the Secret Society in Battle Arena Toshinden 2 a new group of bad guys emerges. Known as the Organization, they wish to use the Toshinden fighters as blood sacrifices for a ritual to summon their dark god.****The number of fighters has been raised from Toshinden 2's 15 characters to a notably larger 32; 14 starting fighters, 14 Organization counterparts and 4 bosses. Though many of the Organization counterparts have near identical move lists to their equivalent starting character.****Toshinden 3's game play is a radical departure from previous games in the series.****The arenas have been redesigned so that they are now enclosed allowing the ability to send the opponent flying into a wall or the ceiling, though the opponent can recover and use the wall for a counter attack.****The combo system has been redesigned again; now each character has a preset range of combo's, however multiple combo's and special moves can now be combined to juggle the opponent for multiple hits, though once again the opponent can recover and counter your combo.****The games physics have been greatly relaxed to accommodate the new arenas and game play; many attacks launch the opponent clean across the arena.****The U.S and E.U versions of Toshinden 3 feature a slightly different blocking set up to the Japanese version. In the Japanese version there are separate high and low blocks, whereas in the U.S and E.U version the high block has been altered to be an all purpose block and will block both high and low automatically. This small change has a notable impact on the game plays .****The U.S and E.U versions of Toshinden 3 also feature new English voices for several characters and a couple of new game play modes; a comprehensive practice mode and a Survival mode.
Battle Arena Toshinden 4 (Europe)>Battle Arena Toshinden 4>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Virgin Interactive>Takara.>Fighter>3.6>1-2 Players>"The fourth game in the main Toshinden series.  Toshinden 4 attempts to return to the series roots after Toshinden 3's radical departure. As a result Toshinden 4 was ""old school"" for its time.  While Toshinden 4 models it's game play more off Toshinden 1 and Toshinden 2 than 3, it makes what is perhaps the biggest change in the series; it does away with nearly all of the 40+ characters that the series has built up and replaces them with 13 almost completely new characters; only 3 of Toshinden 4's cast have appeared in previous games.  But even they are notably different as Toshinden 4 takes place sometime after Toshinden 3 story wise, hence they have aged. The new cast has some pretty big links to the old cast however and many of their stories and bio's reference the old cast even though most aren't named directly (for instance Lancelot was sent to a certain French noble man to be toughened up, while Fen met a certain spear wielding warrior that his own fighting style is conveniently similar to).  Graphically, Toshinden 4 sacrifices detail for fluid animation and speed, to the point where the original Toshinden arguably looks better overall.  The combo system is once again redone; now the player can make a combo out of any combination of light and hard attacks (high, low and jumping) with the limits that they can only enter each attack once (i.e only one high light slash, one low hard kick etc) and once a hard attack has been inputted, no further light attacks can be entered into the combo. Special attacks have also become more special, generally being considerably more dramatic and requiring more complex button combinations that the past games.  Toshinden 4 also tweaks the series overdrive attacks; now each character has at least two and the bar is split into three segments; one block is used per overdrive attack, though all three can be saved up to activate the new Kishin Kourin attack which bestows a considerable ability increase at the cost of health.  A simple parrying system has been added to Toshinden 4; the player can attempt to repel any weapon based attack or they can use a special counter attack that can counter almost anything, but uses up an overdrive block.  Toshinden 4 introduces multiple arena types to the series; for the first time there are arenas with no edges as well as the standard square and round arenas one can be knocked off for a ring out. Toshinden 4 also introduces a third type of arena to the series; collapsing arenas. As the match goes on holes randomly form in the arena (though warning is given as to where they are about to form). As if to compensate for this new arena type, it is no longer possible to fall off an edge of the ring unless you are hit off or accidently perform a move that takes you over the edge.  As well as the standard fighting aspect, Toshinden 4 also has seven time unlocked themed ""mini games"", that include breakout, air hockey and a dancing game.  There is also a comprehensive database mode to unlock that includes detailed information about every character, sound bites, a jute box and character design sketches including some rejected costumes.  As well as all these extras, Toshinden 4 has pretty much every fighting game mode out there."

With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it...****This fourth installment of the  Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the  previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for ""masters"" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well."

Brigandine - The Legend of Forsena (USA)>Brigandine - The Legend of Forsena>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atlus>Hearty Robin.>Strategy>4.1>1 Player>"Brigandine is a war strategy simulation game set in a active world where all of your army units and your enemy units fight and grow continuously.****The story takes place on the continent of Forsena where a coup d' etat has taken place in the kingdom of Almekia. You have a choice of selecting one of five characters from surrounding kingdoms to conquer the kingdom of Almekia and return peace to Forsena once again. ****Gameplay is very much like other tactical games in that you first select the kingdom to attack, attack that country, organize your troops and repeat that process until victory. The gameplay is reminiscent of Ogre Battle in that when you envade a country you then select the towns or bases in which to attack to conquer that country. Your units will upgrade with experience from fighters to knights and barbarians to berserkers. Summon monsters like dragons and hydras to fight on your side which will grow with experience also. ****As with Final Fantasy Tactics, the Zodiac (a favourite of 90's Japanese RPG's) plays a role in determining every units effectiveness against another.  Elements (Fire, Nature, Water, Thunder) and Alignments (Neutral, Light, Dark) also figure into damage.****The progression of a battle involves sending three Rune Knights and their retinue of monsters to represent your side.  Each Knight has a number of ""rune points"" calculated off of level, class, and particular attributes.  Each monster requires a number of rune points to have in the party, ranging from a ghoul (15) to a Lucifer (125).  Regardless of rune power a Knight can only have 6 units in his retinue.****Each castle/fort/town produces a set number of 'Rune Energy', which is set against the 'upkeep' cost of all alive units.  In this way larger nations sustain more powerful fighters, smaller nations must sacrifice fighters who they can not upkeep, and saving up rune energy can allow a nation to quickly bolster forces after a defeat.****The majority of the game takes place in 2D sprites except for the battle scenes which take place in full 3D polygons."

There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die.****There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors.****In order to be successful, you must sneak past cameras and other devices, in order to find out the truth behind the terrorist takeover.

Bushido Blade (USA)>Bushido Blade>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SCEA>LightWeight Co., Ltd.>Fighter>3.8>1-2 Players>The Bushido code of honor governs the actions of the Samurai and sets a code of ethics for use in fighting. Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring.****Bushido Blade is a unique fighting game, in that Square did away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allowed for battles to be won with a single hit. This realism made the game a fan favorite among certain groups. ****Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. ****Battles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there's a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a 'POV' mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game's versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up.****Gameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo'd. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make Bushido Blade one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around.

Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. ****Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body.****Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes.

Carmageddon (Europe) (En,Fr,Es,It)>Carmageddon>2001>ESRB - M (Mature)>Ubisoft>SCi Entertainment Group.>Driving>3.3>1-2 Players>Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).****At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.****Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

CART World Series (USA)>CART World Series>1997>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>SCEA>SCEA>Driving>3.4>1-2 Players>CART World Series, endorsed by Championship Auto Racing Teams, is Sony's first attempt at the world of CART racing. With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game.****All of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you'd like****Modification comes in the way of tweaking a car's performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car's tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory.****In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.****As far as gameplay goes, you've got the following options: Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you're still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season.****Additionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.

Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.****Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of ""special moves"" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.****The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes."

The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.

Championship Manager Quiz (Europe)>Championship Manager Quiz>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Eidos Interactive>King of the Jungle>Quiz>2.3>1-2 Players>Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch out from their successful football management series called, funnily enough, Championship Manager. If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn't just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you've scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn't see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you've got to answer correctly for as long as possible.

It boasts twenty teams, a choice of pitch, and five game modes: •Exhibition: A single match where the player(s) select the sides •League: played with four, eight or sixteen teams •Cup Tournament: a four, eight or sixteen team knockout game •Time Attack: where the player wins if they score x goals within a time limit •Arcade: where there are power moves available •Penalty Shootout: here the game is decided by who scores the most penalties in a four shot shootout, if the game is tied then this will go to a sudden death mode. Depending on the mode the player can alter the difficulty, the length of each half, and the strictness of the referee. There are twenty-five teams, five of which are locked at the start of the game. The teams are not licensed teams so the player selects a country's flag and gets a generic team, for example selecting Canada's flag brings up a Montreal team.  The game starts with a dropped ball and from then on plays as any soccer game. The game auto-selects the player nearest the ball as the active player and their movement is controlled by the left joystick, kicking is controlled by CROSS - holding down CROSS triggers a power bar which adds pace to the shot. When a goal is scored the game restarts from a goal kick, goal kicks and throw-outs are the only time the player controls the keeper as all saving, or otherwise, is automatic.  The game does have a commentary, it is not the flowing naturalistic commentary that is found in some games rather it is a set of standard phrases such as 'Hard Tackle!"", ""What a Scorcher!"", ""Good Shot!"" and ""Go On, Shoot!"", that are triggered by in-game actions. As well as the standard phrases the game also has a couple of unexpected ones like ""What The Heck!"" and ""Punch Him!""."

Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.****Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle.

Circuit Breakers (USA)>Circuit Breakers>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Mindscape Inc.>Supersonic Software.>Driving>3.6>1-2 Players>"Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.****The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.****The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.****Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a ""bird's eye"" viewpoint.****Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap)."
City of Lost Children, The (USA) (En,Es,It)>City of Lost Children, The>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Psygnosis>UGC D.A.

You travel through the streets at the whim of Pieuvre, the siamese twins who are your schoolmistresses. You do small robberies for them, but soon a larger plot emerges. Mysterious men called Cyclopses are kidnapping children to steal their dreams. You must determine what is truly happening in this adventure game.
Civilization II (USA)>Civilization II>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision>Microprose>Strategy>3.9>1 Player>Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.  As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.  There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.  Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.  There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.

From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn't appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. **While the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.****But there's more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams' buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams' properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. **As time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.****The player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). ****The difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which  actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.

CT Special Forces (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl)>CT Special Forces>2002>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>LSP>Hip Games>Shooter>3.6>1-2 Players>CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.  The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.  The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).

Having destroyed the terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are going back to do training missions, but more and more reports about new terror threats keep popping up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or maybe Network is back for a second round? It's up to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of terrorism once again!  The game plays in 5 different game modes. The majority is made up of side scrolling platform action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, where you pick up various weapons, grenades and even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every now and then you'll come across a wooden sign with a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game into first person view, where you have to shoot terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you'll find a parachute pack, and you'll have to play a mini game where you have to make two meters align to make a drop successfully with your parachute.  There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One is a top down shoot'em up, where you have to bomb land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, where you have to save hostages and bring them to your base, while gunning down enemies across the stage.

Demolition Racer (USA)>Demolition Racer>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Pitbull Syndicate>Driving>3.5>1-2 Players>Demolition Racer is a racing game with a twist.  Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars.  The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.****There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game.  This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks.  It is for practice and just plain fun.  The main style is Demolition.****In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall.  You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car.  When you finish the race, your final position is**found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in.  So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race.****The next style is The Chase.  This style is your normal race game.  You can still take damage and so can the other cars, but you are only trying to win the race.  You don't get any points for hitting the other cars.****Chicken is another style.  It is the same as The Chase except that you drive in the opposite direction as everyone else.  This can slow you down when you run into the cars coming around from the other direction.****The next 2 game styles aren't done on race tracks.  They are done in an arena.  This is a circle area which may have hills in it where you just try to destroy cars.  The first of these is Last Man Standing.  In this style, you try to destroy every car without being destroyed yourself.  You can still win if you**aren't the last car by making a lot of points by hitting other cars.  The scoring is calculated the same as the Demolition style.****The final Single Race style is Suicide.  In this style, you try to destroy yourself before any others are destroyed.  You don't get any points for hitting other cars in this style.****Besides the Single Race, there is also League Racing.  In League racing, you are trying to beat a set of tracks.  There are 4 leagues on tracks and one league in the arena.  In order to beat a track (or arena), you must place in a certain position.  The first league starts out easy; you can finish in 5th place and still beat the track and go on to the next one.  However, as you go up in difficulty of leagues, you will eventually have to place 1st on every track in the league to beat it.  A league will usually have 5-10 tracks to beat.****After you beat a league, you will unlock cars, tracks and other leagues.  There are 11 tracks, 3 arenas and 8 cars that you can get.  The cars can be customized with colors and logos.  You can also have portraits of the racers on top of the cars.
Descent (USA)>Descent>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Interplay>Parallax Software Corporation>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>"The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed ""Material Defender"", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.****Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).****The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals."

The player has total 360-degree movement of the ship to navigate through the twisting mines and is equipped with over 20 specialized weapons.****Descent Maximum was the second and final Descent game available for the Playstation game console.

The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points.  As the tiles accumulate on the screen, the water level at the bottom starts to proportionally rise, receding when enough blocks are destroyed. The health meter for the main character is displayed below the gamefield, decreasing when suffering injuries from bomb explosions or drowning. The character also dies after being crushed against the top by the blocks. Power-ups and other items can be found inside containers that randomly appear on the pile, that have to be broke open with three punches to reveal their contents. The blue items give bonus points, eliminate all the tiles of a particular color, lower the water level and help in other ways, while the red items do the opposite and have to be avoided.

Diablo (USA) (En,Fr,De,Sv)>Diablo>1998>ESRB - M (Mature)>Electronic Arts>Climax Group>Role-Playing>3.3>1-2 Players>Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.****As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.****Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.****Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.****Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.

A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.****Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find ""plugs"" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player.

The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose ""vitality"", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. ****For each killed dinosaur you receive ""Extinction Points"". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in ""Save Shops"" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and ""tools"" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or ""cards"" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. ****While wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including ""Dino Files"", which contain a flavor description of a dino species."

There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the ""holoduke"", and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.

Tricks are smoother and may come a little more easily, but players will still have to hold the right line and perfect their timing if they're going to be real contenders in the Motocross circuit. Players will race through several indoor and outdoor tracks in this dirt bike simulation from EA SPORTS, and a freestyle mode is available as well, offering a perfect track for maximum air and wild tricks. The most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well. Besides, with this game's new hold-the-accelerator-and-don't-let-go approach, gamers will get a better sense of the speed they would experience in they actually participated in a motocross event.

How about a freestyle jump-off where you pull of tricks and maneuvers to impress the fickle fans and hard-nosed judges! You like your racing to look real eh? How about real physics for all of the motorbikes so racers will actually jump and land with the proper acceleration and angle. In the jump off, the players will sail over jumps and execute their tricks with the same confidence of their real-life counterparts.

Taking place (appropriately enough) in 1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a worthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is not an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and looted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.  Gameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory. In addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture. These are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle of the game or can be accessed via the main menu. 
Egypt II - The Heliopolis Prophecy (Europe)>Egypt II - The Heliopolis Prophecy>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Cryo Interactive>Cryo Interactive Entertainment>Educational>2.3>1 Player>Although named Egypt 2 there are only a few similarities between the first game, Egypt 1156 B.C. and this point and click adventure. This game actually takes place earlier in time than its predecessor. Offering historical background and facts about Ancient Egypt, it has been categorized as edutainment as well as an adventure game.  The game takes place in the city of Heliopolis, the City of the Sun, which was the center of learning and one of the most important capitals of Egypt in 1350 B.C. Your character is Tifet, a young priestess and a student of medicine, who sets out to find the cure for the horrific epidemic which is spreading rapidly throughout the city population. It becomes very personal when her adoptive father contracts the disease. As the story unfolds, Tifet uncovers a diabolical plot of deception and treachery. 
Ehrgeiz - God Bless the Ring (USA)>Ehrgeiz - God Bless the Ring>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Squaresoft>Dreamfactor>Fighter>3.8>1-2 Players>"Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring is an arcade-style fighting game from the makers of the Final Fantasy series. In the port for the Playstation - Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, Zack, Red XIII & Sephiroth from FF7 join the many characters from the arcade game released in Japan. This is a free roaming beat-em-up that can only be likened to the more recent Power Stone on the Dreamcast.****Comprised of the main arcade mode, mini-game mode, and an all new RPG mode known as ""Brand New Quest"".**** The mini-game mode contains four games:**** - Battle Beach, a triathlon of button mashing.**** - Battle Square, tackle-Othello on a disco floor**** - Infinity Battle, an endurance test with unlimited lives.**** - And a foot racing game using the fighting game controls.**** The main game mode is an arcade-style fighting game.  Charismatic fighters from around the world compete in a tournament for a mysterious sword as the prize.  In addition to your archetypes of kick boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists there are also animal type fighters, homing missiles, characters with swords, and many other attacks that shake things up.**** The fighting system is based on attack height (much like Bushido Blade) - with the triangle, square, and x buttons corresponding to high, mid, and low attacks respectively.  There are also different buttons for low and high guard - both working against mid-level attacks but specific to high and low attacks.  The circle button is used for 'special' attacks, which drain the 'special' bar.  There is a button to jump, as well as a button that changes between 'locking' on the target to move or free running.**** The standard balance in fighting games is speed vs. damage.  Whether it be ranged or melee attacks, the 'damage per second' should be the same - as every character has an equal health bar.  Ehrgeiz is a very balanced game, despite the complexity presented by how fundamentally different most characters are.**** The vast differences between certain characters require the player to devise separate strategies for different opponents. The animal type opponents, for example, can only be hit with roughly half the attacks of the normal opponents - head kicks, many long range attacks, and most throws will hit empty air, especially since animal characters can 'duck' even lower to the ground. Fighting a gun wielding character will result in a battle where you must chase and pin down. Fighting Cloud or Sephiroth will require both constant pressure and vigilance against being thrown to ensure that they are not able to unsheathe their sword and finish the fight in a few blows. **** The game features unlock-able costumes and characters, as well as 'ending videos'.**** The ""Brand New Quest"" feature is a dungeon delver that uses the fighting game engine along with randomly generated dungeon layouts to create a 25 level dungeon with set bosses.  It borrows the magic and equipment system from the Final Fantasy games, you will collect materia and magic stones, as well as a full range of visibly different weapons and armour.  This game puts strong emphasis on food (like the early Ultima series).  Not only will you have to eat, but you will have to be conscious of what you are eating - your diet affects how your stats change at level up.  Eat meat for strength, minerals for dexterity, carbs for speed, lipids for defence, and vitamins for magical ability.  Standing still allows your depleting 'stomach' meter to fill your health.  If your hunger meter reaches 'zero', however, it will start draining your health.  **** There are two playable characters, and the game can be played with both characters or with only one."

You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.****The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very ""industrial"", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire."

This mode is a ""light"" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).****The main gameplay change was the addition of ""First Touch"" controls.

However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king's orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king's inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal.  The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters.  The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full.  Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters' abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class: dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game's plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants.  The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.

King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.  Meanwhile, a young traveler named Bartz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and an old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destroyer of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost.  Final Fantasy V is a role-playing game that uses the Active Time Battle system first introduced in Final Fantasy IV. It also incorporates the Job/Ability system from Final Fantasy III, which keeps the core gameplay centered on four main characters and allows the player to change their classes, or 'jobs'. A new feature lets the player assign an ability from one job to a character who has another job.

Final Fantasy Anthology - Final Fantasy VI (USA) (v1.1)>Final Fantasy Anthology - Final Fantasy VI>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Squaresoft>Squaresoft>Role-Playing>3.9>1-2 Players>"A thousand years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as ""magic"". The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as ""Esper"", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.  The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn.  Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game's collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion."
Final Fantasy Chronicles - Chrono Trigger (USA) (v1.1)>Final Fantasy Chronicles - Chrono Trigger>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Squaresoft>Squaresoft>Role-Playing>3.8>1-2 Players>"A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day: he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention: a teleporter. Upon his arrival Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca's new device. However, Marle's pendant affects the teleporter's mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.  Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.  The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.  As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new ""techs"" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies' positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.  Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game's plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game's final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a ""movie theater"" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross."

Zidane and his buddies first plan to kidnap Garnet from her mother's palace. But shortly after the kidnapping, they realize the queen of Alexandria is up to something evil. Zidane, the princess, and other characters they encounter on their journey decide to join forces and to find out what can possibly drive the queen to commit her cruel deeds.****The game is set in a medieval environment and generally looks more like the first games of the series than its two immediate predecessors. It utilizes the classic ATB (active time battle) combat system, and revives the class-based gameplay of earlier Final Fantasies - each character belongs to a certain class and uses his/her own unique attacks. Weapons, armor, and accessories allow you to choose and to gradually learn various abilities (magic spells, immunity to certain status changes, etc.) by participating in battles while equipping them.****Returning from Final Fantasy VIII is the card game, now called Tetra Master.

Front Mission 3 (USA)>Front Mission 3>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Squaresoft>Squaresoft>Strategy>3.5>1 Player>"Yokosuka, Japan, 2112 AD. The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.****Front Mission 3, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) ""Impact"", (F) ""Flame"" and (P) ""Piercing"". In practice these types function as weapon ""elements"" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability ""Double Shot"" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.****Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the ""network"". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the Front Mission 3 plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.****Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a ""weight"" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot."

In a similar vein to Atari's 1983 Star Wars arcade game, the computer is actually flying the ship, and the players are simply gunners given plenty to shoot at. In addition to bringing home the coin-op's ""Project Dragoon"" scenario, another entire mission, ""The Rising Of Gourb,"" is also included. This mission allows players to follow up their recent rescue of the Earth with a desperate mission to save another world from the alien menace.

Inspired by the ""walk-in"" theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players. While the computer does the flying in this first-person shooter, the players are trigger-happy gunners with plenty of alien ships crowding the sky as targets. Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star.

Unlike several horse racing games from this time, you get to control the horse on the track instead of just watching. Actually, you really control the jockey.

However, you can't drive the horse on for the entire race, or else it'll tire and you'll be left in the dust.****Once the race is over, you get your cash. Each place earns you a specific amount, which you can then use to improve your ranks of race horses.

Grand Slam '97 (USA)>Grand Slam '97>1997>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Virgin Interactive>Burst>Sports/Basketball>3.5>1-2 Players>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.****Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.****Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.****Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.****Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:****- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.****- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.****- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.

Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar's appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.
Grand Theft Auto (USA)>Grand Theft Auto>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Rockstar Games>DMA Design>Action>3.6>1 Player>"In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.****The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the **big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple ""ditch-a-hot-car"" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.****Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.****The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car."

Hunchback of Notredame (Europe)>Hunchback of Notredame>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>The Code Monkeys Ltd>Puzzle>1.8>1 Player>Hunchback of Notredame is a novel by Victor Hugo published in 1831. The title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which the story is centered around. The story dates back to January 6, 1482, the day of the 'Festival of Fools' in Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer, is introduced by his crowning as Pope of Fools. Esmeralda, a beautiful Gypsy with a kind and generous heart, captures the hearts of many men but especially those of Quasimodo and his adopted father, Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his lust and the rules of the church. He orders Quasimodo to get her. Quasimodo is caught and whipped and ordered to be tied down in the heat. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, offers him water. It saves her, for she captures the heart of the hunchback. She is later accused of the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo attempted to kill in jealousy, and is sentenced to death by hanging. Quasimodo saves her by bringing her to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary. Clopin rallies the Truands (criminals of Paris) to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda. The king, seeing the chaos, vetoes the law of sanctuary and commands his troops to take Esmeralda out and kill her. When Quasimodo sees the Truands, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is hanged. Quasimodo pushes him from Notre-Dame to his death. Quasimodo then goes to Mount Faucon (a huge graveyard in Paris where all hanged bodies are thrown), lies next to her corpse and eventually dies of starvation. One year later, excavationists find the skeletons of Esmeralda with a broken neck and Quasimodo locked in an embrace.

JumpStart Wildlife Safari - Field Trip (USA)>JumpStart Wildlife Safari - Field Trip>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Knowledge Adventure>Digital Illusions CE>Adventure>2.8>1 Player>Part of the popular Jump Start series, JumpStart Wildlife Safari: Field Trip is a learning activity game for PlayStation aimed at ages four and up. Intended to introduce and reinforce a number of skills including counting, alphabet, and shape recognition, the game uses the Jump Start's Early Discovery characters Kisha, Frankie, and Casey to accompany children through five different environments of learning activities. Also featured is JumpStart's Adjust-for-You learning technology, which recognizes individual progress and continually adjusts to keep the challenges from being too hard or too easy. Kisha and Frankie have been separated from Casey, and he is now lost on the safari grounds. Children help find him by playing as either Kisha or Frankie and completing all three levels of each environment. Difficulty increases with each level, and after one environment is successfully completed, players earn one letter toward spelling Casey's name. When completely spelled, Casey is found and will then become available as a character for selection. The Cat's Den, Goat Island, the Hatchery, Songbird Garden, and Polar Bear Mountain are the five areas for play. In the Cat's Den, children practice distinguishing similarities and differences as they return cubs to their respective mothers. On Polar Bear Mountain, children use color, pattern, and shape recognition as they ski down a flag-staked mountain choosing flags that match the color and shape of a specific flag pattern. Goat Island reinforces the alphabet as players rebuild log bridges, the Hatchery uses number recognition and counting through ten while children return eggs to mother ostriches, and Songbird Garden introduces music and pattern recognition. A game separate from the safari is also included in the Photo Booth and is accessible from the area selection screen. Here, children can play a memory game where matched cards disappear to reveal a hidden picture beneath. Bonus stars can be collected throughout each level, enabling more images to become available in the Photo Booth game.

Killing Zone (USA)>Killing Zone>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim>Scarab>Fighter>1.7>1-2 Players>"Seven infamous monsters from Frankenstein to the Minotaur go head to head in this early PlayStation fighting game.****These initial seven monsters are all there is; there are no hidden characters to unlock or a final boss to beat.****Most of the characters are slow and un-manoeuvrable. This may be by design to represent the weight of the monsters; most of them are big and their fighting styles could be considered anything but skill based. For instance the Skeleton can jump on the opponent and stab them in the neck repeatedly with its sword while the Minotaur gores them with its horns. It must be said that the attacks in the game generally fit their respective monster.****There are only two game modes available with the main one being the standard ""Normal Mode"" where one player goes up against the six other monsters and finally a mirror match.  A second player can join in at any point (in fact it's the only way a second player can play as there is no Vs mode). If one completes this mode they are presented with a breakdown of their performance in each fight, though no ending in the real sense, as the game has no story at tall to explain why these monsters are fighting each other.****The second game mode is an innovative mode the game calls ""Auto Mode"" and devotes most of its manual to. In this mode the player functions as a side line trainer to train and guide an AI controlled monster (selectable from one of the same seven as the Normal Mode) through several tournaments. This is done by pressing various buttons on the controller to tell your monster to try to perform certain offensive or defensive plays.****The monster you are training start's of with little more than the ability to throw a punch and is slow to respond to your prompts, but will gain additional attacks and respond quicker and more intelligently to your prompts the more it fights, until it ultimately gains the full range of attacks it would have in the Normal Mode.****However the full potential of this mode is undermined by the games lack of any save feature."

Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the ""insolence"" of receiving a new evolutionary ""dark gift"", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...****Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the ""material"" world into the ""spectral"" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability (""dark gift"") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.****The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are ""block puzzles"", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas."

Little Big Adventure (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)>Little Big Adventure>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts>Adeline Software>Adventure>4>1 Player>Somewhere in the universe, there is a beautiful planet called Twinsun. It is populated by four different races, which have been living in peace and prosperity, until a mad scientist Dr. Funfrock of the Quetch (human-like) race used his newly invented cloning and teleporting techniques to create an army of fearsome soldiers and become the planet's dictator. Twinsun's inhabitants have not lost hope, placing their faith in the old legend about the benevolent goddess Sendell who would save the world. However, Dr. Funfrock totalitarian regime forbade displaying any images of the goddess and her worship. A young Quetch named Twinsen was just a regular fellow until he had a dream, which surprisingly involved the outlawed goddess. It seems that Dr. Funfrock was no stranger to mind control; in his opinion, even dreaming of the goddess was illegal, and he promptly ordered to put the perpetrator in prison. Now the unlikely hero must find a way to escape and eventually save his planet from the clutches of its insane ruler.  Little Big Adventure (Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure in the US) is primarily an adventure game with strong action elements. As usually in adventure games, the hero must talk to other characters, and collect and use objects. However, not all the problems have to be solved with dialogue and item manipulation. The player can activate four different behavior modes for Twinsen: Normal, Aggressive, Athletic, and Discreet. The first is used for peaceful exploration and conversations; Aggressive mode allows Twinsen to punch and kick other characters; Athletic mode must be applied when it becomes necessary to run quickly and jump; Discreet effectively puts Twinsen in a stealth mode, making it possible to sneak by hostile character unnoticed. While activation of a particular mode is often required to solve a problem, many situations can be dealt with in different ways.  The game universe is rendered with characters in full 3D, while the environment uses isometric graphic tiles. The CD version (which was released earlier than the floppy one) features pre-rendered animated cutscenes, audio music and speech; all these features are absent from the floppy disk version.

The kits and teams are authentic, with 8,000 players and 294 clubs in 32 countries. As a manager, you control the club finances, take care of coaching, stadium development and player management. During the matches, shown in 3D, managers can make tactical changes and substitutions at any time. There is also an after-match TV show with results, highlights and commentary.

Lode Runner (USA)>Lode Runner>1998>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Natsume>Patra>Puzzle>2.8>1-2 Players>Lode Runner for the PlayStation is two games on one disc. First, there is Lode Runner: The Legend Returns, a graphically enhanced remake of the computer classic. Secondly, there is Lode Runner Extra, a sequel of sorts that continues where the former game left off. In The Legend Returns, the once green and fertile Earth is now a cesspool of filth, made this way by centuries of pollution. What remains of humanity resides deep within caverns, searching for gold, a substance still considered valuable. With enough gold, a person can buy safe passage from the planet. Chief among these Lode Runners is Jake Peril, a man who spends most of his time climbing ladders and ropes, walking across platforms, falling off platforms, digging holes and, of course, scooping up piles of gold. As you guide Jake around the underworld, grabbing all the gold so you can progress to the next level, a subterranean cult of gold worshippers will follow you around and make your task difficult. You can dig holes to momentarily trap these Mad Monks, but you should be careful not to trap yourself or touch a monk. As you go from level to level, the gold will be harder and harder to gather as you are basically forced to figure out puzzles that will enable you to dig your way to, fall on, or otherwise come in contact with the gold. Lode Runner Extra is similar to The Legend Returns, but with the addition of bombs, goo, teleporters and other tools for use in outwitting the Mad Monks and rival Lode Runners. In this game, the monks have abducted Jake (right after he found enough gold to escape the planet) and banished him to their deepest, deadliest caverns. Once again, Jake must gather enough treasure to escape the planet. The two games combined have more than 300 levels. In addition, there is a special Construction Mode that lets you place ladders, keys, guards, exits, hideouts, doors, patches of ground (platforms), holes, gold bars, skulls, and other items wherever you wish. Ten different backgrounds and 10 types of music are available.

M&M's - Shell Shocked (USA)>M&M's - Shell Shocked>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Simon & Schuster>Boston Animation>Action>2.6>1 Player>In M&M's - Shell Shocked , the 2 lead candies are about to set off on a vacation until the red candy realizes that the yellow candy left the M&Ms Minis in charge of the candy factory. The Minis promptly steal the secret M&Ms formulas and cause havoc at the factory. It is up to the yellow candy to set the situation right.  The gameplay has been described as being similar to the Crash Bandicoot series. The action in the game takes place over 8 levels. The first 7 levels involve some kind of math skill (configurable at various skill levels to cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The first level depicts the yellow candy frantically driving back to the candy factory. Along the way are math formulas on the side of the road, followed closely by 3 crates on the road, each with a number. Striking the crate with the correct answer for the previous formula will allow passage, while the 2 wrong answers are steel crates that will end your vehicle. The same action is repeated in a later level involving a forklift.  Another type of level has the yellow candy jumping from number platform to number platform according to the math formulas that a disembodied female voice calls out. Another type of level is a 3D running/jumping action level in which the yellow candy will run down a hallway while observing clues about math formulas along the way. At the end of the hallway will be 3 doors, each with a possible answer. Choose wisely.  All along the way are M&Ms candies to be collected in large quantities. Every 100 M&Ms candies earns the player an extra life.  The PlayStation version is basically the same game but minus the Math mode.

The game has 50 levels, called ""worlds""; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to ""restore the equilibrium"" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. ****To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it ""yours"". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect ""your"" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the ""castle"" spell at it to make it bigger. ****The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. ****There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though. ****Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time."

Magical Tetris Challenge (Europe)>Magical Tetris Challenge>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SCEE>Capcom>Puzzle>3.7>1-2 Players>Magical Tetris Challenge is a Tetris game that combines the classic puzzler with the Disney license, and offers two original competitive Tetris variants: Magical Tetris and Updown Tetris.  Both follow the standard Tetris template: Tetris pieces fall onto the playing field from the top and must be arranged so they form horizontal lines which are then removed, with the player whose stack of pieces reaches the top first losing.  In Magical Tetris, clearing two or more lines at the same time sends a magical attack to the opponent, which puts a non-standard magical piece into their queue. Magical pieces consists of more than four blocks and are thus harder to place, but can theoretically clear more lines at once. Magical attacks can be countered by clearing lines while the piece is in the queue. This sends the piece back to the opponent, changing it to a 2x2 square piece. Countered pieces can again be countered, growing in size with each counter to a maximum of 5x5. Overflow to an already full queue turns existing pieces into ones marked with an exclamation mark. These can't be countered and are massive in size and come in pyramid or diamond shapes. A clock counts the time during Magical Tetris - each minute of game time raises the game level, up to a maximum of 4, with higher levels resulting in more magical pieces added to the opponent's queue per cleared line.  Updown Tetris is less complex. Attacks against the opponent are made by clearing two or more lines, which are then (minus one column) added to the bottom of the opponent's playing field, pushing their stack higher.  Both modes include another gameplay element: the magical gauge is filled by clearing single lines or through attacks made by the opponent. Filling the meter clears the entire playing field above a certain threshold and simplifies the block structure below it. The meter is then cleared and the threshold rises, requiring more moves to fill it a second time. The threshold can only be lowered by clearing all blocks off the field.  The two modes are available in story and two-player modes. In story mode, players select one of four Disney characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy and Minnie) who each come with their own storylines. The game then consists of consecutive matches against the other characters and the bad guys (Pete, Big Bad Wolf and Weasel), with cutscenes between matches.  Only the home versions have an endless mode, which offers standard Tetris and Magical Tetris.

It hit the Japanese arcade in 1994 and was followed by a Japanese release to the Saturn and the Playstation in the following year.  The game is set in a fantasy setting with steampunk elements. Lush forests and medieval castles meet steam trains and mech robots. Instead of piloting the genre-traditional space ships, Gunbird lets the player chose between five different characters (Ash, Marion, Valnus, Yuan Nang and Tetsu) who traverse the game world on broomstick, jet packs and pedal-powered helicopters on a quest to find the pieces of a magic mirror across seven stages. Unorthodox vehicles aside, the gameplay follows traditional genre standards. The main goal is to dodge all bullets that fill the screen while collecting power-ups to make the character stronger. Gunbird features one power-up that incrementally increases the firepower of the standard weapon (P-items) as well as additional ammo for the screen-clearing special ability (B-items). Standard weapon and special ability differ from character to character. Where some characters excel in high firepower in a straight line others allow for a wider spread of bullets or additional homing missiles.

That's right: every CD you own (including PC ones, musical and even 3D0 games) can be used to generate a different monster."
Monster Rancher 2 (USA)>Monster Rancher 2>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tecmo>Tecmo>Strategy>3.6>1-2 Players>Monster Rancher 2 is at heart an arena fighting game with a lot of ancillary game play thrown in. As a trainer of a fighting monster you have to train, reward, punish, cajole and bribe your minion to build up its statistics. You then take your monster into the arena where it battles with other monsters for cash prizes, prestige, and better stats.**Like the original Monster Rancher, this game allows players to create a monster using an innovative technique: you can stick in any CD you own (PlayStation, audio, PC, or other) and the data that is read off the CD is used to generate the characteristics of the monster.
Monster Rancher Battle Card - Episode II (USA)>Monster Rancher Battle Card - Episode II>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tecmo>Tecmo>Card Battle>4.9>1 Player>Monster Rancher BattleCard Episode II is a sequel to the Monster Rancher Battle Card game on Game Boy. But it takes advantage of the PlayStation's superiority in graphics and processing power and adds more complex storyline quests, and expands the card game itself. No knowledge of other Monster Rancher games is needed, however, characters from prior games do play pivotal roles in the storyline. ****For the first time, players can see into the personal lives of the characters in the Monster Rancher world, and interact with them while attempting to win matches of the collectible card game, to collect enough cards to complete quests. Along the way, the player is able to visit various locales and meet up with old friends and new acquaintances.****The card game itself features a  tutorial mode, on screen help, and the option to turn animations on or off. It is easy enough at low levels for almost anyone to learn the basics, but offers options and higher levels of complexity to reward more patient, and older players.****Cards are acquired through defeating opponents, and via an in-game shrine where you can use music CDs, PlayStation games, or PC CD-ROMs to make cards. The CD shrining feature is unique to the Monster Rancher games.****The game also features a 2P mode designed for players who have played the game on their own and acquired their own cards (and tried and tested their skills) to play card games against each other. It is adequate, but unrelated to the in-game storyline.

Armed with the ability to bounce slow or**fast and to the right or left, characters must move from one end of a**playing course to the other, avoiding dangerous obstacles and holes along**the way.

MonsterSeed (USA)>MonsterSeed>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SunSoft>NK System>Strategy>2.2>1-2 Players>Not much of a fighter? Like to work with exotic animals? Like helping people? Then start gathering your seeds today!****Monster Seed obviously takes influence from the popular animal raising/fighting genre; specifically games like Pokémon and Monster Rancher. Of course, it does do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games.****Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.****Combat itself uses a somewhat typical turn-based system, with a grid used to determine character locations, spell ranges and so on. Much like a normal RPG, you get to take turns giving commands to your main character and your monsters. Different monsters are better suited for different roles, with some better off hanging out in the back, attacking from a distance and others in the front lines, absorbing the damage and dishing out the hurt.****Monster Seed isn't the most innovative RPG/breeding game out there, but it is a decent game that will help any fan of the genre pass the time.

The player has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over the screen. If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore.****In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the ""Lesshühner"" which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC version there is an online highscore list."
Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd geht weiter (Germany)>Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd geht weiter>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Phenomedia>Similis>Shooter>3.5>1-2 Players>Moorhuhn (distributed as Crazy Chicken in English-speaking countries) is a German casual game franchise for PCs and the Nintendo DS. It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which - a shoot 'em up - was Germany's most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Originally the star of an promotional campaign for undrinkable whiskey Jack Daniels, Moorhunh has starred in over thirty games during the years, including five kart racing games. Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd Geht Weiter gameplay is like the first Moorhuhn game, the hunter in front of the screen must shoot down as many grouse as possible in 90 seconds. This generates points. That's it. Simple, but effective! Certain basic principles remain the same: 90 seconds, grouse flying around the landscape, shooting the above (the grouse, not the landscape!!!) yields points. That was enough for part one, but there had to be more in the sequel. So the game this time is filled with loads of hidden puzzles to solve in order to spur on the fans' passion for the hunt. 
Moorhuhn Kart (Germany)>Moorhuhn Kart>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Phenomedia>Similis>Driving>2>1-2 Players>Moorhuhn Kart is a kart racing game. The game features five generic locations (countryside level, a slippery ice level, a mountain level with dangerous sections,a desert level and the last lap of the Grand Prix takes places in a fiery lava level), five characters and a set of weapons. Player can either try to beat the tracks in the Grand Prix mode, against three computer-controlled players, or beat the best times on their own in the Time Trial mode. While racing, there are power-ups to collect, such as turbo to increase the speed, chewing gum to make the other karts get stuck, and an egg to throw to slow another car down. Players can choose from 5 characters: Moorhuhn, Lesshuhn, Moorfrosh, Pumpkin and Schneemann. 
Moorhuhn X (Germany) (En,De)>Moorhuhn X>2005>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Phenomedia>Similis>Shooter>3>1-2 Players>Moorhuhn returns with a complete redesign in 3D in this sequel to previous titles of the Moorhuhn shooter series. Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player's dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games: the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.

Failing to do this, the cube creatures kidnap all the baby chicks down a well which lead to their world. Now it's up to a chicken with superpowers, named Mort, to head down the well and rescue those baby chicks. The game is broken up into stages in which Mort goes around searching for the baby chicks to rescue. Once he collects the chicks, he has to return them to the well at the start of each stage. He must be careful of the block shaped enemies that are trying to impede his efforts. To attack his enemies, Mort can peck and comb whip them. Mort can also crack open eggs to find power-ups such as springs, invincibility, or even an ability to launch baby chickens at any of the enemies. If an enemy does hit Mort he will lose some health. To restore health, Mort can eat corn and beans which are strewn among the ground of each stage. Mort can also collect stars and coins which will increase the player's score.  In between each stage, two newscasters, Chicken Little and Henny Penny, give up-to-date commentary on current happenings which help move the story along.

The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.****In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.****Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &quot;use&quot; and &quot;turn around&quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.****Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines.

Namco Soccer Prime Goal (Europe)>Namco Soccer Prime Goal>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco>Namco>Sports/Soccer>2.8>1-2 Players>J-League Prime Goal EX is one of the first football games in Sony's console, following previous appearances in the SNES, Prime Goal is a straightforward action game with simple arcade controls. While the Japanese version features all 14 JLeague teams and fully licensed players, the European version features the same number of national teams with fictional players, all from Europe. Game modes include friendly match, league and cup knockout modes, as well as an all-star game where the player chooses his stars from the best in the selected zone.  Graphically, the game uses a polygonal playing field, while players are represented using sprites, and gameplay features a combination of the face buttons to perform actions (passing, lobbing, shooting, tackling and so on) with shoulder buttons to add swerve to the ball, change team tactics on the fly or pushing the camera backwards to find an open team mate.  While gameplay is fast and simple, it has three quirks: first, unlike most modern offerings, the AI does not set up the target players for passes and crosses, making the player control the target player as soon as the ball is released in order to place them in the best position to complete the play, and also unlike most other games, the players are able to run freely off-bounds, allowing the player to capture a free ball close to the touchlines without risking touching it for a throw-in. The final main gameplay feature can be seen when the ball carrier faces a defender, as the camera quickly changes to behind the forward, as he tries to trick the defender into going the wrong way as the defender tries to steal the ball by predicting where will the forward move, with the winner of the challenge being able to run a few meters unopposed.

Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.****Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.****The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:****1. &quot;Hot Spots&quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.****Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &quot;on-fire,&quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.****&quot;Juice Mode&quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.****&quot;Tournament Mode&quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

Once the players units make their moves, it is then their opponents turn to move their units. Players can use their various units to attack the opposing forces. Battles sequences are turn based. The outcome of a battle can be affected by the terrain, any support fire present, an encirclement effect, plus the individual strengths and weaknesses of the unit types that are involved in the skirmish. Since both the player and the enemy forces have access to the same unit types, the game emphasizes knowing each units strengths and weaknesses, and the strategic placement of units. Also on the battlefield, players will have access to their factories which allows for additional units to be deployed and gives the player the ability to repair their weakened forces.  This Main Campaign mode brings to the table an all new campaign, while the Original Campaign consists of the entire original campaign from the 1989 game.  The game also features Mini-Campaigns, over 40 individual maps ranging in 4 different map sizes (1x1,1x2, 2x1, and 2x2) that were created by fans of the game.  The Single Scenario mode is locked at first and can be accessed only when the player completes all the campaigns. This mode offers support for 2 players to do battle with each other.  The game has the options of having the battle animations be in 3D, 2D, or turning them off all together, plus altering which buttons confirm and cancel orders given in the game.  There is also a scenario editor where players can create their own scenarios.

Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.

To do so, a photo must be placed in a folder, imported and then hotspots (head shape, eyes, nose and mouth) must be set, to define how the texture will be mapped into the face model. ****Gameplay became a lot faster and tougher, and two new moves were included: ""Big Hit"", to flatten the oppositions' golden boy, and ""Special Movement"", to go around those tough defenders with ease.  Other new features include individual player and goalie boost (to give an handicap for a team), jersey selection, including classic throwback jerseys.****One of the most important changes done to the game was how the game timer worked: before, the period length on the clock matched the time set by the player, but starting with NHL 2000, every period has 20 minutes which are compressed into the time set by the player. This makes penalties a lot shorter (a minor elapses in just 30 seconds in a five minute period setting) thus reducing the powerplay percentage, which experienced players could keep in the high 90's in previous games, but also fixes the handicap of goaltenders in played games (a goaltender that suffered a single goal would have his GAA a lot higher than a goalie that suffered more goals in a simulated game).****The rest of the game remains as usual: 28 teams can play in a season (with the ability to choose between a short, medium or long season length), setting the then new NHL overtime loss point, playoffs (with best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches), international tournament and shootout. The beginner mode continues to be featured, and allowing players to feel the ice for the first time without having to deal with complicated controls, penalties or tough opponents. ****Bill Clement replaced Daryl ""Razor"" Reaugh in colour commentary, and Jim Hughson remains in play by play. Alternative rock band Garbage provided the lead track (Push it!, from their Version 2.0 album)."

The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.****As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode."
NHL 99 (USA)>NHL 99>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>EA Sports>EA Sports>Sports/Hockey>3>1-8 Players>"After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.****Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.****As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a ""Brett Hull"". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.****The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.****Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary."

He must escape, but he can't leave his friends to mercy of those eaters.

The game has several unique gameplay features. Abe is almost completely helpless, cannot wield weapons, and can be easily killed by his brutal enemies. That's why most of the game involves moving with careful timing, sneaking, and outsmarting your foes, even though there are also many parts where Abe runs and jumps, as in most platformers. Abe's only power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while, and also to open ""bird portals"". Opening those portals is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using what the game calls ""Gamespeak"". Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple one-button commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as ""Hello"", ""Follow me"", ""Wait here"", etc.****The game has pre-rendered background graphics, and uses pre-rendered CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels."

Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore's influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore's plan, and restore free choice to humanity.****The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards.

By placing another tenant where these arrows are aiming at will help diminish their stress. At the same time, some tenants will exert negative effects in the form of red arrows. Tenants on the receiving end of these arrows will get stressed out. You can switch tenants around and make new rooms for them but it will cost you money. The key is to arrange the tenants in a certain way so that they all balance each other out harmoniously...otherwise they will leave without paying rent and the room will explode - forcing you to lose income and dish out to repair the damage. To prevent this from happening, you will have to observe your tenants Stress Gauge that tells you their current stress level. Another factor to watch out for is Syndicate 5 - a group of criminals that moves in and disturbs your tenants. When they do, try to drive them out by placing tenants around them that will send them red arrows. Every now and then they may go out of their room and cause trouble. If that happens, change to Security mode and move Polpo to where the criminal is. When he's there, Polpo can blow his alarm whistle at the criminals which will send them scurrying back to their hide-out.  The game has two modes: Story and Endless.  In Story Mode, Putica, Polpo's little sister, is kidnapped by Chocopape who is jealous of One Piece Mansion's success. To save Putica, Polpa must complete 7 orders. These orders are goals that must be met before you can tackle the next stage. The goals include making a certain amount of income, building a certain number of rooms or building a certain number of floors. Can Polpo handle all these challenges? Well it is up to you to make sure he does! The game is divided into stages and every now and then you will have to confront a ""Boss"". Just drive them out as you do the criminals.  In Endless Mode you can select from 3 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard. There are no stages or ending, you just try to run One Piece Mansion your own way and see how far you can go."

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!****PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.****Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!****The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.

Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects.

At first, it seems that the giant Sebec corporation and its manager Guido are the ones responsible for the terrible accident. But Guido is not the only one the young heroes have to confront - they must look deep into their hearts, and perhaps find the truth there...****Persona is the beginning of a sub-series in the Megaten universe, and one of the few Megaten games to be released outside of Japan. Like all Megaten games, Persona makes it possible to contact demons during random battles. In this game, demons can award the player with a spell card. If the player combines spell cards from different demons they can fuse more powerful creatures (personae), which can then attach to player characters, changing their parameters, strengths and weaknesses, and teaching them new spells. While important locations are isometric, dungeons are explored from a first-person perspective.
Persona 2 - Eternal Punishment (USA)>Persona 2 - Eternal Punishment>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Atlus>Atlus>Role-Playing>4>1 Player>"In Eternal Punishment, you play the role of Maya Amano, a young journalist who lives and works in a modern-day Japanese city called Sumaru. A series of mysterious murders have been troubling the city lately. Maya has to make a report and goes to a high school where the murders have taken place, together with a fortune-teller Ulala and a detective Katsuya. When they arrive at the school, they find the principal murdered. A man appears - a man with a bag on his head, who calls himself ""The Joker"". He says Maya and her friends will never defeat him unless they call upon their Personae - their other selves who can appear as mythical figures and help them in battles. The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons... and perhaps the demons that live within their own hearts?****Eternal Punishment belongs to the Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe, and like in all Megaten games, it allows you to communicate with the random enemies. You can choose a party member to talk to the demons you encounter, flatter them, threaten them, make them give you Tarot cards that will allow you to summon more powerful Personae, or make contract with them in order to get information or rare items. You can also spread rumors around the city and see how they influence its life.****This is a direct sequel to the game  Persona 2: Innocent Sin."
Persona 2 - Tsumi (Japan - Translated)>Persona 2 - Tsumi>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Atlus>ITL>Role-Playing>4.1>1 Player>"A few years after the events described in Persona, a curse has befallen Sumaru City, a town in modern-day Japan. The curse is placed by a mysterious person who calls himself the Joker. Rumors say that he can fulfill people's wishes, but also does something horrible to those who for some reason fail to express a wish. A group of high school students decides to investigate the matter. However, when they confront the Joker, he tells them that they have hurt him in the past, and that he is out for revenge now. The young people realize that the Joker's appearance is just the beginning of a sinister chain of events, and will have to look for answers within their own souls.  Persona 2: Innocent Sin is similar in structure and basic gameplay to its predecessor. Much of the game consists of navigating a party of up to five active combatants through locations in the large city, exploring complex dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based style. Unlike the first game, dungeons are viewed from an angled overhead perspective with rotatable camera. Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon.  Like in the previous game, communication with demons plays a significant role. The demon conversation system has been refined: it is now possible to choose more specific and accurate dialogue lines, and the effects of the player's responses are less random. Tarot cards of a specific Persona type are collected from the demons following a successful conversation. They can be later used in a special location called Velvet Room to acquire new Personae, which can be equipped on playable characters, enhancing their parameters and teaching them different spells and abilities. In the beginning each Persona is only capable of a basic ability; new ones are gradually learned by repeatedly using the powers of said Persona in combat. Powerful fusion attacks can be performed by combining two or more spells in the same round.  The game introduces a ""rumor system"", which allows the player to acquire and spread rumors through rumormongers inhabiting the city. Due to the curse placed on the city, rumors become reality once they are spread. This predicament can be used to the player's advantage, for example by spreading a rumor about powerful black market weapons."

In stages where players take control of Tinkerbell, they have to fly throughout the stage keeping a torch lit while avoiding obstacles that would put the torch out.  In between stages players can visit the Indian shop where they can spend their feathers and buy things such as pixie dust, tips, and a health boost. Also players can use the film reels they found and view the actual clips from the animated feature film the game is named after.
PGA European Tour Golf (Europe) (En,De)>PGA European Tour Golf>1999>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Infogrames>Infogrames>Sports/Golf>3.2>1-2 Players>European PGA Tour Golf is the latest offering from Infogrames, attempting to nestle itself in an already bloated market of golfing games. Have you got what it takes to conquer all in the European Tour? The game is officially supported by the European Tour itself. All the player names you'd expect to see in their respectively skilled tournament are included. It'll take a little work to get to meet the likes of Nick Faldo in the professional world. PGA European Tour Golf features six authentic courses, including Druid's Glen in Ireland, The Islands in Italy and Hanbury Manor in England. I can only take their word for it that they are indeed authentic, not having seen or played on any! In addition to the serious tournaments, you also have five fun variants too. These are Clock, Hazard, Island, Night and Super Shootout golf. More importantly, for the amateurs amongst you, there is a set of practice modes too. The player begins with the two-day AMA Season tournament, consisting of 24 golfers over 36 holes. It needs to have achieved a handicap of 0 (zero) at the end of the season, to enable you to progress through to the Challenge Tour tournament. Easier said than done.

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).****The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.****Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

He swallows it and starts to attract metallic objects and creatures. This upsets the balance of the world, and evil creatures start to appear throughout the land. Phix must travel to five realms in order to bring the stone to its original place and return peace.****Phix: The Adventure is a 3D platform with a magnetic element similar to the earlier Super Magnetic Neo. The main character attracts or repels objects and enemies by switching polarity (between north and south with the ? button). Touching the enemy decreases the number of hearts at the left bottom of the screen. Falling on pits or water kills Phix instantaneously. The ? button shoots magnetic particles (enemies can be killed by particles of opposite polarity: north enemies are affected by south particles, and vice-versa). Pressing and holding the ¦ activates a neutral field that lasts some seconds and shields Phix from the magnetic activity around him. The X button makes the character jump. To reach higher places, Phix first must connect to magnetic spots on the ground by selecting the opposite polarity and then switch to the same polarity. Activating the neutral field at this exact moment makes him jump even higher.****The game has five worlds, each with three regular levels and a boss stage. It starts with two lives and a timer for each level (the character dies when it runs out), and allows progress to be saved to the memory card.

A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.  In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.  In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and ""myst"" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on ""CASTLE"", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the ""ERRANTRY"" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.  In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the ""LONGINUS"" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the ""BEAST"" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the ""HOLY GRAIL"" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot."

Pool Hustler (USA)>Pool Hustler>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision>Ornith>Sports/Pool and Dart>3.9>1-2 Players>Doukyu Billiard Master (known as Pool Hustelr outside Japan): You're a hustler, baby. Weaseling your way from underground pool halls to even seedier settings, the objective is to play the best game of pool possible while wagering high amounts of cash. But no matter how good you think you are, there's always someone better than you...or is there? Pool Hustler will give you the opportunity to find out! Pool Hustler features several gameplay options including the Lesson, Story, Two-Player, Practice, and Trick Shot modes. Outlined somewhat in the first paragraph, the Story mode features a city map with six different pool halls. Players will go around to the various halls, make wagers, and try to beat one of 12 different pool champions. Just be careful not to bite off more you can chew -- you'll be left with an empty wallet and the game will be over. Your opponents range from hustler wannabes to actual pool sharks; the short tempered Joseph acts as a stepping stone for victory while Morgan learned to play a mean game of pool during a 35-year prison sentence. Each player has his or her own unique style and grasp on the fundamentals of pool theory, so watch yourself! The Lesson and Practice modes are great for new players; while the former teaches players the mechanics of pool via tutorial sequences, the Practice mode is there for practicing trick shots and angles. It even allows you to place balls on a table in any manor you desire! When you've got the necessary skills to take on your pool shark friends, challenge them to a Two-Player duel! Players can select between four different games including Nine Ball, Eight Ball, Rotation, and 14.1 Continuous. Finally, the Trick Shot mode features 30 unique trick shots for the player to master! Players are required to play in accordance to strict, but realistic rulings. For example, if you sink the cue ball or fail to hit the lowest numbered ball in Nine Ball, you'll be fouled. If you're playing by professional rules only, three fouls result in automatic disqualification. Additionally, general rules are followed such as lagging for break, calling shots, and break options. So get out there and show them who's the real Pool Hustler!

Once a sport is selected, players can elect to play a Tournament Game or Last Man Standing. Tournament consists of a series of ten increasingly difficult multiple-choice questions worth 100, 200, or 300 points apiece. Players who continually answer correctly after buzzing in will receive a ""streak"" multiplier in addition to points, but an incorrect answer deducts points from their total score. The person with the most points at the end of the game wins, receiving an overall ranking as well as a possible Hall of Fame induction after achieving a high score. Last Man Standing follows the same structure but with a finite number of allowable misses, the default being five. Once this number is reached, the next player in line continues until only one remains. Both trivia contests conclude with a gold, silver, and bronze medal ceremony based on overall points. High scores, rankings, and question progress (from the pool of 4,000) are then saved to memory card. "

It is possible to send rows of stones to the other player in three different modes, depending on the attack pattern the player selected. The third mode is time attack: here the player competes for the fastest time destroying 50 rows of gems. The final mode is called rapid mode where the player competes for the highest number of rows they destroyed.****It is also possible to play against a human opponent. In this mode, difficulty and handicaps can be selected by the players. The player who wins the most rounds is the winner of the multiplayer match.

The player can select the tactics - from the three field players (the goalkeeper can't leave the goal area), it's possible to pay more offensively (with 2 in front and 1 in the back) or defensively (2 in back and 1 in front). While the real tournament was traditionally played on public parks and car lots, the game version includes these and more exotic settings, such as an airport, a ships' deck or in the middle of a city crossroad. The grand finals are always played inside an indoor arena.****After a team manages a number of shots, they are entitled to three ""supershots"", which are much more powerful and swerve a lot more than regular shots. The three shots, if well used, can turn a game upside down in a matter of seconds or mean the team will have to do a lot to make up for them if spoiled. While building up the Supershot gauge, the player has to rely on well placed shots, header, volleys, bicycle kicks or moving the ball in attack very quickly to score. ****By winning competitions, players can unlock Puma-sponsored stars, such as JJ Okocha, Lothar Matthaus, Angelo Peruzzi or Gianluca Pagliuca and compete with them in their national teams."
Punky Skunk (USA)>Punky Skunk>1998>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Jaleco>Ukiyotei>Platform>3.7>1 Player>Punky Skunk is a side scrolling platformer where the titular skunk has to rescue his friends from a mad wolf who is threatening to take control of the world. Like in other games of its kind the player has to make his way through the levels by running left and right, jumping and using a spray attack to take out the various enemies that stand in his way. To complete a level the player has to reach a flagpole and attack it. When hit by an enemy the skunk loses one of his green orbs (which acts as hitpoints) and when all out of these a life is lost. More orbs can be earned by taking out enemies. Collectable stars can be found all around the levels and by getting a hundred of these an extra life is earned.  The player will come across various extreme gears that allow him to progress through the levels. Once a gear is equipped the regular spray attack can not be used. There are six gears but only one can be equipped at a time. These include the diggers which allow the player to dig through earth in a Dig-Dug fashion, the paraglider which allows him to use air currents to his advantage, the pogo stick that allows him to jump higher, the skates which allows him to move really fast and the snowboard which allows him to gain speed on downhill slopes. There is also a jetpack that is only available towards the end of the game.
Putter Golf (USA)>Putter Golf>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Agetec>Amedio>Sports/Golf>2.2>1-4 Players>"Putter Golf is a 3D miniature golf simulation. It features both a ""normal"" 9-hole course, with realistic courses, as well as a ""trick"" 9-hole course, with somewhat more unusual features, such as warp zones and conveyor belts. Rounding out the package is a mix mode, with randomly selected holes from both courses, and a practice mode that both allows you to practice hitting on various slopes, and try out the features from the trick mode.****You can compete both against the CPU, on multiple difficulty levels, and against up to three other players."
Puzzle Star Sweep (USA)>Puzzle Star Sweep>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Agetec>Axela>Puzzle>2.6>1-2 Players>"In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score points by eliminating ""star blocks.""  A star block is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of two like-colored blocks touch each other.  While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen.  The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks."
Puzznic (USA)>Puzznic>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Mud Duck Productions>Altron>Puzzle>2.4>1 Player>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.****There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)****The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.
Q-bert (USA)>Q-bert>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari>Digital Eclipse>Action>2.5>1-2 Players>The hip character from the 1980's returns in a new, 3D puzzle adventure. This time, you must help Q*bert save his friends, while solving all of the detailed 3D level that are part of 4 unique worlds, while avoiding the bad guys at the same time. And that's no easy task. Powerups litter the levels, while warp points can get you out of all those sticky situations.
Qix Neo (USA)>Qix Neo>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Mud Duck Productions>Taito Corporation>Puzzle>3.5>1 Player>QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.****The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.
Quake II (USA)>Quake II>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Activision>Hammerhead>Shooter>3.1>1-2 Players>A sequel in name only, this follow up to id’s 1996 Quake, is a first-person shooter revolving around the Earth-Strogg war. The Strogg alien race threatens the Earth, but Earth has launched a counter-offensive, Operation Alien Overlord. Overlord takes the battle to the Strogg homeworld with the ultimate objective of securing their capital city and killing their ruler.****As a FPS, Quake II contains a variety of weapons including the fall back Blaster, the Railgun, and the secret BFG10K. Health, armor, and ammunition pick-ups can be found during levels, as can the classic Quake’s Quad Damage power-up. Game play involves mowing down alien opponents as the player progresses through levels, completing in-game objectives. Quake II also comes with multiplayer support for Deathmatches.

Second, you now have unlimited continues.****R-Types also contains a small library section which describes some of the story behind the R-Type universe, and lets you browse some of the in-game graphics. Other bonuses include an FMV intro movie and ending movies.
R4 - Ridge Racer Type 4 (USA)>R4 - Ridge Racer Type 4>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco>Namco>Driving>3.9>1-2 Players>"Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the Ridge Racer series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by the first game of the series.****While it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the Real Racing Roots '99, Ridge City's three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year's Eve.****The player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder): Micro Mouse Mappy, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, Pac Racing Team, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions Racing Team Solvalou, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team Dig Racing Team, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents.****After picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available: Lizard and Assoluto keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but Age Solo and Terrazi offer a new experience with their ""Grip"" cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns.****The player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the Shooting Hoops speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.****R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco's innovative Jogcon controller."
Racing (USA) (En,Fr,Es)>Racing>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>A1 Games>Tamsoft Corporation>Driving>1.6>1 Player>Racing as the title suggests is a simple racing game. It features both a short and a long distance race course, a mirrored version of the long course, plus different skill levels. Before a race begins, players select a car (out of 6 total), and then set whether they want automatic or manual transmission, and whether they want a drift or grip setting. ****Races have the player racing against 3 opponent racers. Players try to attain the fastest lap times and the fastest total race time while trying to defeat their opponents. The players fastest times can then be saved.****The game also contains a brief tutorial that explains the controls and some techniques of racing.

Each of the courses take you through a multitude of ancient landmarks, cities, natural wonders such as light houses, tunnels, waterfalls, ruins, European styled villages etc. The graphics however have transformed from bubble gum like unrealistic environments, to drab and very realistic racing courses.

It contains almost near perfect translations (or ""ports"") of Raiden and Raiden II from the arcade versions.  ****Raiden is the name of the fighter/bomber that the player flies to destroy and rid mankind of the aliens that have invaded Earth in 2090.  Raiden consists of eight vertical scrolling missions where the player maneuvers the Raiden craft dodging and destroying enemy robots, buildings, ground targets, and air craft.****Raiden II picks up three years after the player has destroyed the first invasion of aliens.  They are back, after raising another army!  Raiden II is more of the same, a vertical scrolling shoot'em up.  It has additional weapons, new enemies and terrains.****The game can be played alone against the computer hordes or another player can join along to fight simultaneously.  There are several types of ""weapons"" and ""power-ups"" the player can acquire by destroying enemies that make their Raiden ships more powerful and destructive.  One of the most unique and recognizable weapons from ""Raiden"" are the thermonuclear bombs.

Rally Cross (USA)>Rally Cross>1997>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>SCEA>Sony Computer Entertainment America>Driving>3.4>1-2 Players>A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  ****Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  ****One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.
Rally Cross 2 (USA)>Rally Cross 2>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>989 Studios>Idol Minds>Driving>3.2>1-2 Players>The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross.  The lead programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds.  Rally Cross 2 was one of the first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve.  ****Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps and crashes.  Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the sequel, but 2 player split screen remained.   The ability to control attributes such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large palette.****Once again the courses can be raised forwards or backwards, and in suicide mode(cars racing in opposite directions at the same time).  The multi-race, season mode, still exists.  One of the biggest additions is the track editor.  There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a 2D grid to create completely new tracks.  ****The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in the original.  Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in an upside down car.

The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.****The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.****The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful ""cartoon"" flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.

Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.

As Jill ""master of unlocking"" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.****A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. ****Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.****The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.****The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score."

For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other ""Road Rashers"" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. ****There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.****There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.****If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.****The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver.

Robin Hood - The Siege (Europe)>Robin Hood - The Siege>2004>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Phoenix Games>Phoenix Games>Shooter>2.8>1 Player>"Robin Hood (christened Robert) is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who was born in approximately 1290. A highly skilled archer and swordsman, he is known for ""robbing from the rich and giving to the poor,"" assisted by a group of fellow outlaws known as his ""Merry Men."" Traditionally Robin Hood and his men are depicted wearing Lincoln green clothes. The origin of the legend is claimed by some to have stemmed from actual outlaws, or from ballads or tales of outlaws. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure starting in medieval times continuing through modern literature, films, and television. In the earliest sources Robin Hood is a commoner, but he was often later portrayed as an aristocrat wrongfully dispossessed of his lands and made into an outlaw by an unscrupulous sheriff. The books often had political-cultural undertones, championing Anglo-Saxons as heroes and the Normans (whose conquest of England began in 1066) as unjust tyrants. Light gun shooter, also called light gun game or simply gun game, is a video game genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller. Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets, either antagonists or inanimate objects. Robin Hood the Siege is a gun game in the style of games like Operation Wolf series based on the famous character, the game was published only in Europe in the year 2004 by Phoenix Games. "
Robo Pit (USA)>Robo Pit>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>THQ>Altron Corporation>Fighter>3.9>1-2 Players>"Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.****Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of ""boss"" robot is put in your way. These ""bosses"" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!****The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them."

Each body part has its own attack and durability ratings that determines how the robot will fare in combat. ****The battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as experience and skill points.

There's also a guard impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts. A battle ends when one of the combatants has his energy reduced to zero.

The gameplay principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn't kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate.****Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.

Shanghai - True Valor (USA)>Shanghai - True Valor>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SunSoft>SunSoft>Action>2.8>1-2 Players>"Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding ""free"" tiles of the same type. For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining. Shanghai features two game modes, Classic and Arcade with an option for two-player split screen action. In the Classic mode, the traditional tile game is played from a 3D viewpoint. To get a better view of the free or restricted tiles, the camera can be rotated around the pyramid. The Arcade mode is a bit different in that it features game modifications. Going up against the computer AI or a second player, you choose a character and pick a variation of the classic game, such as playing with four sets of tiles on a rotating cube. The two-player head-to-head feature involves removing tiles and finding power-ups, like Tetrisphere for the Nintendo 64. The game features an online rules listing that can be accessed any time from the menu system. Additionally, players can customize time limits and the tile sets from the options screen. Shanghai: True Valor also supports the PlayStation Mouse for better control of the cursor. "

There are four modes of play•Exhibition mode where the player picks both teams and plays as one of them. •League mode where a player selects a team and plays through an entire season with the game simulating all other results. The teams in this mode are restricted to the English Premier league for the 1997-1998 season (*see note below) •Arcade mode is a knock-out tournament •Tournament mode starts with four groups each with four teams in each which can be manually or randomly populated. Here the teams within each group play each other and the group winners play for the trophy. There is a limited team management function within the game. Prior to the match the player can decide on their preferred formation, and can assign roles such as man marking to their defenders and so on. The game is licensed by the Professional Footballer's Association and so can use footballer's names, however all team emblems and strips are fictitious.  The teams available in the Exhibition Match mode are Arsenal, Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Everton, Huddersfield Town, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Stoke city, Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, Tranmere Rovers, West Bromwich Albion, West Ham United, Wimbledon and Wolves.  *However the teams in the League are not quite those that played in the 1997-1998 season. The league is largely correct but Bolton Wanderers and Crystal Palace are missing and have been replaced with Middlesborough and Sunderland.

Sol Divide (USA)>Sol Divide>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>XS Games>Psikyo>Shooter>3.2>1-2 Players>Set against a medieval fantasy backdrop, Sol Divide is a 2D side-scrolling shooter that pits one or two players against a horde of flying enemies. There are three different characters that can be played as, each with their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire.****The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge).****Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection accessories (if playing Original Mode).
Sonic Wings Special (Europe)>Sonic Wings Special>2004>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>MediaQuest>Video System>Shooter>3.7>1-2 Players>A secret organization called Fata Morgana is developing a weapon that is capable of killing or wounding two-thirds of the world's population. A super-national group of combat experts from all over the world called Project Blue has been established to counteract Fata Morgana's evil doings. Sonic Wings Special is an enhanced and expanded port of Aero Fighters Special (Sonic Wings Limited in Japan), a coin-op shoot-'em-up with vertical scrolling. The original coin-op game uses altered levels, graphics and many features from Aero Fighters, Aero Fighters 2 and Aero Fighters 3. The home console version adds new characters and endings, new bosses, updated graphics and unlockable planes. There are also Time Attack and 2-player modes. The game uses a branching stage system, so it is impossible to see all levels in one sitting. There is a total of 14 playable characters and many different endings (some of which are reused from previous games in the series). Overall the game has a comic feel. As of Summer 2012, the Android version of Sonic Wings Special has only 4 playable characters with 4 endings and 9 stages. However, the publisher is planning to add further elements of the original version.
Sorcerer's Maze (USA)>Sorcerer's Maze>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>XS Games>Four Winds>Puzzle>2.6>1-2 Players>"In Sorcerer's Maze (known as Prism Land in Europe) you play as Prism and Rhythm (a cat and a fairy) who set out to save the seven trapped guardians of the land. Gameplay is very similar to Breakout or Arkanoid. Players control a moving paddle (a tail-swinging kitty in this case) to bounce balls and break gems lined along the upper area of the play field.  There are ten worlds with ten levels in each. Worlds include air, seas, rivers, forests, and castles, which primarily just changes the background art. Players are granted score multipliers for hitting gems in quick succession, and lose a ""life"" if the ball falls past the paddle and off the screen. The end of each world is a boss battle, where the player must bounce the ball off the boss' weak spot while avoiding attacks. Two players can also team up, or challenge each other in split-screen Battle Mode.  In addition to points, the player builds up MP through smashing gems and collecting items that fall out. In addition to collecting and activating powerups during play, the player uses MP to purchase powerups at the start of each level. Powerups include multiball, piercing ball, wider paddle, and a comically enormous ball. Graphical effects are used during the boss battles, and with some powerups, to generate snow, stretch the screen, and otherwise bring life to the play fields.  High scores are saved, but progress within the worlds is not. However, the first level of each of the ten worlds is always available at the start. After having saved all the guardians, you unlock the final castle stage."

The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.****Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.****Soul Blade's sequel is SoulCalibur, both in the arcades and for the Sega Dreamcast

The idea is you choose your favourite South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel, and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.

Gameplay takes place across 10 levels with 6 different attack ships to pilot.  The majority of the levels are linear with a few alternate paths.

It is up to you to determine what happened, and fix it. The game mixes typical FPS gameplay with RPG elements. You are inside a giant mech that can transform into a shape fit for walking, driving, and a mixture of both. You can move square-by-square, with 90-degree turns, slide left or right, and look up and down. By defeating enemies, the invisible RPG elements are introduced: you have hit points, energy points, and you can collect weapons and items. When an enemy approaches, this is shown through an icon, along with the distance.****The environment is claustrophobic and maze-like, and includes many enemies. The game features an unusually large amount of plot for a game of this type, mostly consisting of conversations between your teammates, who are always in other parts of the station."
Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels (USA)>Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts>Krisalis Software Ltd>Shooter>3.1>1-2 Players>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the**Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. **It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers.****You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter.

Space Invaders (USA)>Space Invaders>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision>Z-Axis>Shooter>3.8>1-2 Players>"In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to ""the Tank.""  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!****Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.****You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op."
Space Jam (USA)>Space Jam>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>Sculptured Software>Sports/Basketbll>3.1>1-2 Players>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.****The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.****Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.****The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.****The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.****There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.****The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.****There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

Between missions the three pilots will chat about the status of the mission as well as other topics in FMV cutscenes.  The player's craft is equipped with two Vulcan guns. Two additional Vulcan guns are attached to FANG extensions, which operate similarly to the options of the Gradius games. Additionally the ship can fire a very powerful Over Drive beam or turn invulnerable and dash through enemies and bullets with the Booster. Both can be used to start a bonus chain counter to earn additional points, and both also increase the Over Drive Gauge which will cause the ship to overheat and lose functionality if filled. Unlike most scrolling shooter games the player's ship can withstand several hits before it is destroyed.
Spawn - The Eternal (USA)>Spawn - The Eternal>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>SCEA>Sony>Beat-'Em-Up>2.2>1 Player>Spawn: The Eternal is a video game for PlayStation based on Todd McFarlane's Spawn comics.  The game switches back and forth between two styles of play.  There's an exploration mode, which is along the lines of Tomb Raider.  Spawn must climb and jump his way through a variety of environmental obstacles while smashing crates and furniture to find power-ups.****When you approach an enemy, however, the engine switches into something between a 3D fighting game and an old-fashioned side-scrolling beat-em-up.

Two-player offers cooperative split-screen play. The emphasis is on tactical play, although there's plenty of action.
Spec Ops - Ranger Elite (USA)>Spec Ops - Ranger Elite>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Take-Two Interactive>Runecraft>Action>2.7>1-2 Players>This is one of those first generation soldier shooters, that was one of the first games to emphazise tactics before total mayhem.****This game let you lead a kind of special forces which you chose out of a bigger group, like in Hidden and Dangerous. The difference in this game is that it's somewhat more action, and that it's played in third-person view.****The game takes you to several places of the earth, where you have to complete the mission objectives rather than just killing everyone (though completing missions often is about killing) to win the game.
Spec Ops - Stealth Patrol (USA)>Spec Ops - Stealth Patrol>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Take-Two Interactive>Runecraft>Action>2.4>1-2 Players>Stealth Patrol is the first console adaptation of the long-running PC military Spec Ops series. Players command two rangers on a variety of missions. Instead of working with a squad like the PC versions, only two rangers can be controlled. This can be done by two human players working together. When there is only one player, the computer AI takes over the second ranger, but the player can switch between them at any time. Also different in this console adaptation is the change of gameplay perspective from first-person to third-person.****Before starting a mission, players select the ranger best suited to complete objectives, based on five classes: machine gunner, grenadier, rifleman, close quarters specialist, or sniper. Each class has different abilities, and access to specific weapons or items. Each type also has a certain encumbrance, but the equipment can be further customized based on the available options. Some of the included weapons are shotguns, grenades, tripwire mines, machine guns and sniper rifles, but also more general items such as nightvision goggles.****The missions are set in a forest in Siberia, snowy mountains in Bosnia, the desert in Iraq, mountains in North Korea, and the jungle in Vietnam. The radar is an important element during gameplay. When a ranger is shot at, the enemy position briefly lights up on the radar as a red dot. Killed enemies often leave behind medkits and additional item pick-ups such as ammunition.

He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.

Level layouts are less linear and more expansive than many platform games, with lots of sub-quests - exploration is required.****This time around, the fantasy 3D worlds are larger and more complex. Though most of the gameplay elements from the original game have remained, more puzzle elements and bonus levels have been added to this chapter. Spyro has a new ground-pounding move.

Now Spyro has to travel through the dragon kingdom and free all the dragons from their crystal prison, recover the dragons' gems and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. ****Spyro the Dragon is a 3D platform game similar to Super Mario 64. The game consists of six worlds: Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers and finally Gnasty's World. Each world consists of a home or hub area, three regular levels, one flight level and one boss level.****The goal of the game is to beat Gnasty Gnorc by working your way through all six worlds.

Star Fighter (USA)>Star Fighter>1996>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Acclaim>Krisalis Software Ltd>Shooter>3.8>1 Player>"3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being ""convinced"" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.  A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times. In post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies' POV. By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.  One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.  The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame. "

The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.****The player takes control of Kyle Katarn; an Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance.  After a prologue mission where he steals the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his ""Dark Troopers"" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.****Dark Forces features 14 substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer.  Every level has objectives for Kyle to complete (rare, for First Person Shooters of the period), ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.****The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.****Dark Forces is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported."

Street Fighter Collection 2 (USA)>Street Fighter Collection 2>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom>Fighter>3.9>1-2 Players>Street Fighter Collection 2 is the second title in the Collection series and it goes even further back to the classic days of Street Fighter II. ****Included is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively.****Street Fighter II: The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds).****The most significant change to Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out.****Finally, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li's Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.

As the original, Strider is mostly an action/platform game where Hiryû must hack and slash his way through hordes of enemies. The player must use Hiryû's climbing abilities to explore the 2.5D environments, uncovering bonuses and upgrades in the process. By progressing through the story and defeating the many bosses, Hiryû unlocks new weapons and powers, allowing him to reach new areas of Kazakh City. Contrary to his predecessors, this version of Strider is not linear and adopts a semi-open structure in the vein of the Metroid games, although a map and navigation system always indicate in which direction is the next objective.

Striker Pro 2000 (USA)>Striker Pro 2000>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Rage Software>Sports/Soccer>2.3>1-4 Players>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license. UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.  The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.  In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:  Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.  National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.  National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties.  Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.  8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.  Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.

The clue are the scales because of imbalance they go up or down and can catapult the spheres over the whole area! And there can be highest only eight spheres on one scale pan - otherwise game over. Later in a game there will be more and more colors and special items.

The game combined simple, easy to grasp arcade action, insanely catchy music and real NFL players. Tecmo's sequel in 1991, Tecmo Super Bowl, added the NFL license and detailed statistical tracking for an entire season. It was considered by many as the best football game released for the 8-bit system. The series would continue into the 16-bit market, with three games released on both the SNES and Genesis (Tecmo Super Bowl, Tecmo Super Bowl II and Tecmo Super Bowl III). While it would face heavy competition from the Maddens and Montanas, the game still maintained a strong loyal following--a testament to its universal appeal. Tecmo Super Bowl marks its first appearance on the Playstation after success in the both the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets. While the name hasn't changed, the game has undergone several refinements--perhaps none more dramatic than the ability to change the field's perspective. Instead of a horizontal view, you can now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings. The hallmarks of the Tecmo series have been left unchanged: you still get both the NFL and NFLPA licenses, variable weather conditions, stat tracking, injuries, multiple schedules and an emphasis on arcade action. Don't like how your team is performing? Feel free to edit players' names, abilities or trade them away!

Tennis Arena (USA)>Tennis Arena>1998>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>UbiSoft>Smart Dog>Sports/Tennis>2.3>1-2 Players>With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental. What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That's about it for options though. No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash. The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld (USA)>Terry Pratchett's Discworld>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Psygnosis>Perfect 10 Productions>Adventure>3.9>1 Player>"This adventure game puts the player in the shoes of Rincewind, a wizard whose sole purpose in life is to stay alive. He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him. The game takes place in the humorous fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett. The world is called the Discworld, as it is actually a flat disc carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants, which themselves stand on the back of an even larger turtle.  The story is loosely based on the novel ""Guards! Guards!"". Both in the book and the game, a dragon is summoned by a group of mysterious conspirators and now terrorizes the city state of Ankh-Morpork. Being the most expendable wizard of the Unseen University, Rincewind is given the task to get rid of the beast (only in the game though; in the book, the city's nightwatch has to deal with the problem).  Discworld is a classical point-and-click adventure game with a few original features. For example, Rincewind's inventory is limited to two objects, and the majority of his belongings is stored in the Luggage, an intelligent chest with dozens of little feet. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game the player gains access to a time-traveling device and has to send Rincewind to the past and back in order to solve some of the puzzles."

Valkyrie Profile (USA) (Disc 1)>Valkyrie Profile  Disc 1>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Enix>tri-Ace>Role-Playing>3.6>1 Player>"In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.****The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.****The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using ""spiritual concentration"" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each ""chapter"". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs."

Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.****The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using ""spiritual concentration"" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each ""chapter"". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs."
Vampire Hunter D (USA)>Vampire Hunter D>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Jaleco>Victor Interactive Software, Inc>Adventure>3.2>1 Player>Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.  That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi.  You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born.****In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.****The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the PlayStation.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.

Its now up to you to join the forces of the Vanark troopers and save the day before its too late.****Vanark is a 3D action game which plays mostly as a rail-shooter. You fly aboard your state-of-the-art Vanark fighter in a fixed path on several missions controlling your guns and missiles and trying to defeat all the waves of enemy ships and creatures that try to come at you. Every now and then you also get to play free-flight stages in deep space where you have full control of your ship, turning the game into a more traditional 3rd-person space sim.****Additionally, between each stage you get to roam freely aboard your carrier ship using 3D characters over pre-rendered backgrounds. In these sequences you'll get to chat with fellow pilots and move the plot along, which includes triggering cut-scenes as well solving mini-games such as disarming a saboteur's bomb and other similar activities."
Vandal Hearts (USA)>Vandal Hearts>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>Konami>Konami>Strategy>3.7>1 Player>Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements. ****The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).****In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.
Vandal Hearts II (USA) (v1.1)>Vandal Hearts II>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Konami>KCEO>Strategy>3.9>1 Player>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.****Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.****The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.

Take control of Bastion as he wages war against the Junaris Empire to regain control of the continent. ****Gameplay consists of controlling a group of ATAC on missions on a 2D sprite map where players take turns moving and attacking. Once a fight between two ATAC's starts the game is switched to a 3D side view and the battle between the two continues. Use the terrain to your advantage like attacking from above or behind your enemy. ****Follow the story of Bastion and his friends on 56 missions to regain peace on the continent. Your actions before battles and as the results of battles will decide your outcome - with 5 different endings along three separate story lines.
Vanishing Point (USA)>Vanishing Point>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>Clockwork Games>Driving>3.4>1-2 Players>Vanishing Point is an arcade style racer featuring real cars and road course style tracks.  The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock.  Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.****The standard racing game modes are here:  Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race.  One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition.  You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events.  Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.****The selection of cars is quite diverse.  You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.
Vegas Casino (Europe)>Vegas Casino>2000>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Coconuts Japan>Casino>1.8>1-2 Players>Vegas Casino is a game for up to four players via multitap comprising Baccarat, Roulette, Let It Be, Black Jack, Video Poker, Keno and Slot Machines.  It can be played in two modes, Ranking play or Free Play.  In Ranking mode the player enters a target amount to be reached and then plays against their opponents to see who can reach that amount. If a single player plays in this mode the game provides three opponents but the game caters for up to ten players with the game providing the additional AI opponents. Roulette,Video Poker, and Slot Machines in this game mode are played within a split screen.  In Free mode there are no computer opponents and the games are the same as the games played in Ranking mode though there are minor differences, such as selecting which slot machine to play, because in this mode the split screen mode is not used at all.  There are three kinds of slot machine which can be played for different stakes. Keno is the odd game here because it does not appear on the game menu, instead during any game other than Video Poker a casino hostess pops up in her own little window inviting the player to a game of Keno. If the player accepts they are shown a Keno card on which they mark their numbers after which their current game of Baccarat, Roulette or whatever resumes. A short while later the hostess window opens up again and the hostess gives the good, or more usually bad, news on how good their selections were.

The bad parts of the game is that looks more like a demo than to a complete game due to the lack of music and 'cause that the player doesn't have a good control method since he can hide from the enemy bullets or roll to avoid them. 
War Gods (USA)>War Gods>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>Midway>Eurocom Developments>Fighter>2.3>1-2 Players>"War Gods is a one-on-one fighting game that takes place in 3D environments. The fighter under your control can perform many different moves, and string those moves together to perform ""combos.""  Furthermore, the fighters all have special ""finishing moves"" that eliminate your opponent in some gruesome manner at the end of a match.  There are 10 different fighters to choose from, all based on different ancient civilizations.****The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look."
WarCraft II - The Dark Saga (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)>WarCraft II - The Dark Saga>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts>Climax Group>Strategy>2.4>1 Player>Electronic Arts brings Blizzard's best-selling strategy game to the PlayStation and Saturn in this release.  They've combined all the missions from Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and its expansion pack, Beyond the Dark Portal, into one package.  ****You take charge of either the humans and elves or the orcish hordes for control of the lands of Azeroth.  Eventually you work through the dark portal and into the orcs homeland.  You take charge of either side as you work through more than 20 missions per side in the fight for survival.****New features for the console release include an auto-build option, where you can set a queue of units to be produced and the ability to select sixteen units at a time instead of the PC's nine.
WarGames - Defcon 1 (USA)>WarGames - Defcon 1>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>MGM Interactive>Interactive Studios Ltd>Action>4.1>1-2 Players>Inspired by the 1980s movie about a computer trying to take over the world, this action/strategy game allows you to field either the tanks of human NORAD or the walkers of AI-controlled WOPR, in warzones across the world.****You control one vehicle and can cycle through all the units in your current army at any time, and there are limited commands you can issue to the rest of your army. For example, you can tell all the units in your army to follow your vehicle. However this can be unreliable due to poor pathfinding.****There is a huge range of vehicles available for each army, from reconnaissance jeeps and bikes through heavy tanks and walkers all the way to the really special toys, laser and stealth tanks. There are air and sea assault troops available as well.****You receive your mission objectives in e-mails sent from mission control (or WOPR itself) which update as you fulfill briefs. These can be as simple as 'go there, kill that' but sometimes require more complex tasks such as picking up a spy from behind enemy lines, crippling a base's SAM sites to allow an attack from the air, and so on.****One major draw of the game is an enjoyable two-player co-operative mode. Using a unique split-screen view (split diagonally instead of vertical/horizontal) both players control a vehicle each, and can cycle through the rest. This can be interesting as one player lends air support while the other storms the AA sites with a tank, for example.****In addition to co-operative mode, there is a head-to-head multiplayer mode available and about 30 levels in the single player mode.

A replay also allows you to review your best laps.****The game features some original camera (like the helmet view), and offers the possibility to fine-tune your car in simulation mode, so the immersion is total.

Warzone 2100 (USA)>Warzone 2100>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Eidos>Pumpkin Studios>Strategy>3.4>1 Player>Earth's defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer malfunction.  Our planet is destroyed, except for a few factions that rebuild their strength and attempt to dominate the brave new world.  As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all...****You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.  There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.

Whizz (Europe)>Whizz>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami>Flair>Platform>3.2>1 Player>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Junior (Europe)>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Junior>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Eidos>Hothouse Creations Ltd>Game Show>3.3>1-4 Players>Finally what all junior Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? fans have been waiting for! Relive the excitement and tension of the hit TV quiz show, in this junior edition of the best selling Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? computer game. With Chris Tarrant as the host and specially written questions for a younger audience, it's sure to be a huge hit with the whole family. Taking the simple yet effective formula of the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire hit TV show and turning it into a computer game has already yielded Eidos a major success. And with the PlayStation version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire--Junior Edition, a game that does precisely what it says on the box, that success is set to continue. The game closely follows the formula of the TV series as you battle through 15 questions on the way to the jackpot. Throw in three lifelines, Chris Tarrant voiceovers and the familiar graphics and music and the only major difference is the lack of cash at the end of it all. Up to four players can play, either joining forces or going against each other, although the junior target audience of this release does mean that the questions are easier than before (although by no means a walkover). And by not dressing the game up in fancy gimmicks purely because of the younger target market, the game offers wholesome family entertainment that involves the youngsters without alienating the older generation.

Kayaking and canoeing are also known as paddling. Kayaking is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is defined by the International Canoe Federation (the world sanctioning body) as a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks, although ""sit-on-top"" kayaks are growing in popularity, as are inflatable kayaks which come without decks but which have air chambers surrounding the boat. Wild Rapids is the first ever PlayStation game to deliver the adrenaline hit that is white water kayaking. An out and out arcade game rather than a kayaking sim, Wild Rapids nonetheless delivers a realistic physics model giving just the right balance between player control and being buffeted by the water.

Windsurfers Paradise (Europe) (En,Fr,De)>Windsurfers Paradise>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Theyer GFX>Sports/Surfing>3>1-4 Players>Windsurfers Paradise is a 3d sports game based on the Windsurfing sport. Windsurfing is a surface water sport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. It consists of a board usually two to four meters long, powered by the orthogonal effect of the wind on a sail. The rig is connected to the board by a free-rotating universal joint and comprises a mast, wishbone boom and sail. The sail area ranges from less than 3.0 m2 to more than 12 m2 depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor and the type of windsurfing being undertaken. Windsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the later half of the 20th century. But before this, there have been sailing boats of various designs that have used wind as the driving force for millennia, and Polynesians have been riding waves for many of them, undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail.

Having become rich and properous in the previous game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually recovered the ""Joy Chest"" from the very bottom of the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. Peace had returned to the town for some time. After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started reappearing and different parts of the kingdom began turning into ""mysterious dungeons"". It will be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through these strange places and help the king discover what has broken the peace.****Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko: The Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find many items and fight monsters. He can freely move through the dungeons, but each movement or action of his is countered by those of the monsters (if they are present on screen). All actions are made in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. There are all kinds of items in the dungeons including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, magic scrolls which can be read, swords and shields that can be equipped and staffs which can be waved until their charges are depleted. Players must also keep an eye on Torneko's hunger meter and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great rate.****There are several ways to leave a dungeon including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko's experience points and stats are lost. To make money, he must sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room for later use. Torneko's village initially starts small, but as progress in made in the game more and more services and shops will be attracted to it. Some examples of services include a Bread Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a Meldersmith."

Something must be done!****XCOM, or eXtraterrestrial COMbat unit, was founded as an international force to combat the alien menace. Start with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, you must stop the alien threat... once and for all.****X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished... ****You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. ****Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.****In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). ****The game aims to mix strategic considerations, resource management, and tactical combat considerations, along with plenty of authentic UFO lore.
